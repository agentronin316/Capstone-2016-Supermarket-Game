Each waypoint will be a single line
Format for this document will be "Column: File Data: Meaning"
Waypoints will be read in order, and placed into separate lists for Movements and Facings
The engine will run each list in parallel

First Column: Move or Face: Identify if line represents a movement or a facing waypoint

Move waypoints:
Second Column: Wait, Straight, Bezier, or Bezier2 : Identify which movement type this waypoint is
Third Column: Floating point number: This is how long the movement will take in seconds (Last column for Wait)
Fourth Column: Floating point number: this is the x-coordinate of End position
Fifth Column: Floating point number: this is the y-coordinate of End position
Sixth Column: Floating point number: this is the z-coordinate of End position (Last column for Straight)
Seventh Column: Floating point number: this is the x-coordinate of Curve Control Point One's position
Eighth Column: Floating point number: this is the y-coordinate of Curve Control Point One's position
Ninth Column: Floating point number: this is the z-coordinate of Curve Control Point One's position (Last column required for Bezier)
Tenth Column: Floating point number: this is the x-coordinate of Curve Control Point Two's position (If this column is used, 11 and 12 are required)
Eleventh Column: Floating point number: this is the y-coordinate of Curve Control Point Two's position
Twelfth Column: Floating point number: this is the z-coordinate of Curve Control Point Two's position

Face waypoints:
Second Column: Direction_Lock, Location_Lock, or Free: Identify if this the camera will be locked at a point, locked in a direction, or if this is a free look
Third Column: Floating point number: This is how long the camera setting will last in seconds (Last Column for Free Look)
Fourth Column: Floating point number: This is the x-coordinate of the point for the camera to look at (Camera will either lock direction from this, or constantly adjust angle to keep it centered)
Fifth Column: Floating point number: This is the y-coordinate of the point for the camera to look at
Sixth Column: Floating point number: This is the z-coordinate of the point for the camera to look at
